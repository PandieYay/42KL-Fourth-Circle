# 42KL-Fourth-Circle

This Circle might have been the most fun yet

CPP: It's like doing the piscine all over again! A challenging experience but one that definitely improved my understanding of the language. Definitely one of the best projects in 42KL.

NetPractice: Unfortunately this project is a bit scuffed, there are a lot of bugs with the site and sometimes it'll say congratulations when in the logs it says failed to actually connect. It did teach me about ip addresses and masks, but if you want to go truly in-depth this project can be confusing.

cub3d: Coolest math heavy project, I've never really been good at maths but this project forces you to do raycasting and the maths behind it. Final product is a doom (1993) similar styled game, just without the shooting. Other than the maths being hard, using the mlx library in conjuction also proved difficult.
